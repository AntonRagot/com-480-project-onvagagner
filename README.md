## 🔴 Abstract

Have you ever wanted to put words on feelings you have when drinking wine? Have you ever wanted to dive into the wine world and in particular wine tasting?

Then this website is perfect for you!

Our goal is to guide you during your wine degustation. To that extend, each part of our website will aim to make your experience more enjoyable and educational. After going through the basics, we will dive into our senses. Our first stop is the vision: we will help you to indentify the exact tint of you wine and get more information about it. 
Then we move to smell: we will go step by step to identify which scent are present in the wine and develop your sense of smell, as it is often complicated to discern the numerous aromas. Finally, we will end on taste: after presenting the main trait that you should feel, we challenge you to rate those trait and find back the wine variety used in your wine! If you like the wine, we also propose similar wine variety (based on those trait) to try if you like your wine. Of course, a wine taste can be improved by paring the wine with food. We will provide you a small guide on which food to eat with your wine (or the opposite)!

Now that we are all set, grab your bottle of wine, your glass and link on the link above to enter our website!
