                Are you interested in wine but never had the motivation to learn
                about it because it is too complicated?

              <p>
                Then grab a glass, a bottle of wine and let's dive into wine

                  Lets get started ! First pour yourself some

                  When filling it up, try to aim for the widest part of your
                  glass. This will maximize the surface in contact with the air,
                  and will help to bring out the perfume and aromas.

              What color can a wine be ? Easy, we all know that : red, white and

              been classifying wine into these three main categories for years,
              a wine color's is far more important and complex than those threes
              simple categories. The range of colors of wine is infinite. There
              exists hundreds of names and adjectives for describing the color
              of wine. It is a really complex science. However, without getting
              that much into details, we can still get a good understanding of
              the main characteristics of the different colors and the effect
              they have on the taste of the wine. Because yes, before even
              tasting a wine, we can guess a lot about its taste only looking at
              it. But obviously it takes a lifetime of learning before being
              able to do that.

                              a color. When a hue is “toned,” both white and
                              black (grey) are added to the color to reduce the
                              color’s saturation. In terms of the “additive”
                              light color model, saturation works on a scale
                              based on how much or how little other hues are
                              represented in the color.

                    Now that we know how to characterize color, here are a few
                    interesting facts about the link between the color of a wine
                    and its tasting characteristics. Obviously, wine is not an
                    exact science but in most of the cases, these are true.

                      Generally, red wines lose color as they age. Their tint
                      tends to turn to garnet/brown colors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Red wines that are more opaque generally contain higher
                      levels of tannin (Nebbiolo is an exception to this rule).

                      Red wines with higher sulfite additions have reduced color
                      intensity.

                    <li>
                      The hue in red wine is partially affected by the pH level
                      of the wine :
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Wines with a strong red hue have a lower pH (high
                          acidity).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Wines with a strong violet hue have average pH ranging
                          between 3.4 and 3.6.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          wines with a blueish tint are usually over 3.6 pH

              <h2>Smell</h2>
              <p>
                The odor of each wine is unique and recognizing every different
                scent can be a challenge. To make it easier, we classified the
                most common scent in different categories:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Primary aromas</b> are scent that our nose detect that are
                specific to the grape variety (or varieties) used to make the
                wine.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Secondary aromas</b> are scent due to chemical changes
                effected on the wine by the process of fermentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Tertiary aromas</b> are smells we associate with wine aging.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Fault and Other</b> are unwanted ordor that can be present
                due to some winemaking practice or poor storage condition.
              </p>
              <p>
                To capture most aromas, we advice you to take short breaths
                through your nose and breathe out through your mouth. We will
                dive into the different scent in two steps.
              </p>
              <p>
                First your <b>first nose</b> consists of one sniff. With this
                sniff, you should try to identify one family of odor.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, swirl the wine to release the different aromas and for the
                different families, try to identify the exact scent of the wine.

                <h2>Taste</h2>
                <p>
                  Training your taste buds to recognize subtle tastes in wine
                  takes years of experience. For now, let's focus on 5 simple
                  traits that anyone can feel. Take a good sip from your glass
                  and make sure to swish it around in your mouth before
                  swallowing, to get the full effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Sweetness</b> in wine is primarily from grape sugars that
                  are leftover after fermentation, and is less perceivable in
                  wines with higher acidity. <b>Tannin</b>, found mostly in red
                  wine, gives a drying sensation to your tongue. High tannin
                  wines will grip the insides of your lips to your teeth. It can
                  also give a bitter taste to the wine. <b>Acidity</b> is the
                  level of sourness in wine, it makes your mouth water. Low acid
                  wines generally taste round or even flabby and high acid wines
                  taste lighter in body and very tart. The level of
                  <b>alcohol</b> is felt in your throat as a warming sensation.
                  All these traits come together to give you a sense of the
                  wine's <b>overall body</b>. It is essentially a measure of how
                  bold it tastes in your mouth.

                  that are the most similar to your description. Have a look at
                  the varieties listed on the wine's bottle or label. Did you
                  manage to describe the taste correctly?

                  If you didn't manage to identify the grape variety, don't
                  worry ! As mentioned, it takes a lot of practice. Furthermore,
                  to make things even more complex, many winemakers choose to
                  combine different grape varieties (as opposed to using just
                  one) to achieve a very specific taste. However, getting
                  familiar with the taste profiles of well know grape varieties
                  is already a great starting point, so you can explore them
                  here by using the search bar.
